# Advent of Haskell, 2024!

Solving all of this year's AoC challenges in Haskell, once again!

Current progress:

|Day|Stars|Day|Stars|Day|Stars|Day|Stars|Day|Stars|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|01|⭐️⭐️|06|⭐️⭐️|11|⭐️⭐️|16|⭐️⭐️|21|⭐️⭐️|
|02|⭐️⭐️|07|⭐️⭐️|12|⭐️⭐️|17|⭐️⭐️|22|⭐️⭐️|
|03|⭐️⭐️|08|⭐️⭐️|13|⭐️⭐️|18|⭐️⭐️|23|⭐️⭐️|
|04|⭐️⭐️|09|⭐️⭐️|14|⭐️⭐️|19|⭐️⭐️|24|⭐️⭐️|
|05|⭐️⭐️|10|⭐️⭐️|15|⭐️⭐️|20|⭐️⭐️|25|⭐️⭐️|

Some cool stuff I learned / did / remembered this year:
- Simple paralellisation in Haskell (see Utils.hs and Main.hs template)
- Regexes in Haskell (see day 3)
- The magic of Data.Map.union(s)With
- Floating point operations in Haskell (see day 14)
- A nice and sufficiently fast implementation of Dijkstra (see day 18)
- Cliques and how to find them kiiinda efficiently (see day 23)
- A little Vector.hs library with some basic operations (see Vector.hs). (I'd ultimately like to also make a Matricx.hs library, and would also like to explore if / how we can bake dimension into the type system for compile-time checking and less repetitive code.)
- That I finally need to make a Graph.hs library that provides basic functionality like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc. To be done :)
